What is the project about (background & motivation)? Why did you choose this idea?

> The aim of this project is to create a unified system that connects patients to care. 
> Amidst a world where medications are prohibitively expensive and medical care becomes less and less 
accessible, there needs to be a system to help the average consumer.


Who are the target users?

> Patients, Doctors EMTs, and others in the medical field, such as psychologists.

What is the context?

> The medical field currently uses a couple of different systems for managing patient information. 
This creates significant gaps in how patients can receive care. The goal of this project is to create a website that reduces much of the stress that comes with visiting your medical professionals.

> Create a project that can not just bring patients closer to the field of medicine, but also bring some 
transparency to what your care will look like


What are the websites will be able to serve and how?
Include a rough sketch of your idea (if available).
